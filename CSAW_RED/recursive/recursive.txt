Prompt: Onions have layers. Recursions have layers. nc rev.red.csaw.io 5000

When I first ran the executable, the program asked for a number and then
either segfaults or say nope no flag :( Anywho, I fired it up in Ghidra
and look through the decompiled code (see ghidra.txt). So, the gist is
that there is a recursive function, and you must run it 7 times and make it
stop at the 8th iteration, and the function divides your input every
iteration until the number inputted is odd, and then it returns the odd
number. So, by looking at the main comparison to get the flag, the 
final number returned must be 11. To get the number to input, I multiplied
11 by 2 to the 7th power and got 1208. I put in the number and then got the
flag from the server.

Flag: flag{r3Curs1Ve_Rev3rSe}
