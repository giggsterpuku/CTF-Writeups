Challenge: pyprison

Description: What's a CTF without a good, old-fashioned pyjail?

Not a difficult chall, but I just wanted to document my thought process through it. From the main.py file, I noticed that the only characters that
you could use were all lowercase letters and parentheses only, which threw out the traditional object traversing payloads and obvious typing out
import os and whatnot. It took me some sleep and some thought to figure out that functions like exec(), eval(), and input can be used instead, and
I thought it should've went through my head sooner. I realized that I could simply bypass the assertion in main.py by just typing out input(), and
from there I could write whatever characters I wanted since the assertion wouldn't apply there. I tried running it by itself at first b/c main.py
ran exec() on whatever you typed in, but I realized that it was just executing input() but not executing what was passed into it. So, I changed the
payload to be "exec(input())," and the rest is simple: import os and cat a flag.txt.
