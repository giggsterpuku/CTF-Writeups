## Challenge: babygame01

## Category: Binary Exploitation

### Description: Get the flag and reach the exit. Welcome to BabyGame! Navigate around the map and see what you can find! The game is available to download here. There is no source available, so you'll have to figure your way around the map. You can connect with it using nc saturn.picoctf.net [PORT].

### Hints:

#### 1. Use 'w','a','s','d' to move around.

#### 2. There may be secret commands to make your life easy.

Gist: Go into negative x,y coordinates to modify flag attribute of player struct (check the move_player() decompiled code in babygame02 to see where the write primitice lies), then use p to autosolve the game and invoke the flag check to get the flag. If you look into GDB, the flag attribute will be places just before the map buffer in memory (what you rinput affects), so you kust have to move to the very top left of the map and tap "a" a few tiems to overwrite the attribute.

### Flag: picoCTF{gamer_m0d3_enabled_10567bc2}
