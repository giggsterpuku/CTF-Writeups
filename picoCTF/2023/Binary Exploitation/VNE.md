## Challenge: VNE

## Category: Binary Exploitation

## Description: We've got a binary that can list directories as root, try it out !!

### Hints:

#### 1. Have you checked the content of the /root folder

#### 2. Find a way to add more instructions to the ls

Connecting to the remote server, I saw that there was a compiled C binary named bin. Running it, it shot an error, saying that SECRET_DIR was not defined. From the way the undefined object was capitalized, I figured that SECRET_DIR is an environment cariable that needed to be set. I also figured that its value would be used by ls to list out directory contents, so I first set the SECRET_DIR to /root. Low and behold, it showed a flag.txt file inside of it. The second hint made it easy for me to figure out how to exploit the binary: continue BASH code exeution by chaining a cat flag.txt command. A semicolon, && or || should do the trick to concatenate the commands together into a string to be saved into an environment variable, and with that I got the flag. My payload looked like this:

```bash export SECRT_DIR='/root; cat /root/flag.txt'```
