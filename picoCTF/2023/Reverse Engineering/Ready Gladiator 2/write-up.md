##Challenge: Ready Gladiator 2

##Category: Reverse Engineering

##Description: Can you make a CoreWars warrior that wins every single round?

###Hints:

###1. If your warrior is close, try again, it may work on subsequent tries... why is that?

I was not able to complete the challenge, but it seemed that the way to beat to Imp had to do with simple strategies and using basic warriors. Apparently upon looking up some codes that worked to eliminate the Imp in CoreWars, Bombers are the best warrior types against replicators like Imps. [This link](https://corewar.co.uk/heremscimitar.htm) came from a write-up from [cyber_guru](https://github.com/Cyberguru1/PicoCTF2023_Writeup) that I looked up after the CTF, and it has a bomber that I found that worked.
