Challenge: What's your input?
Points: 50
Description: We'd like to get your input on a couple things. Think you can answer my questions correctly? in.py nc mercury.picoctf.net 39137.

Interesting thing I learned from this challenge. I know from pyjail stuff that
input() is a vulnerable function for evaluating stuff, particularly allowing
you to write code into a Python program. However, for this chall, the vuln
with it is specifically tied to the version of Python used to run the
binary, Python 2 (as hinted by the hint). The vuln is that you can access
variables/methods in the program by simply typing in their names. The in.py
file given has 3 vars, but the main one we need is city because it will
give the flag. So, all I had to do was type in 'city' as the input, and the
city value being compared was the randomized city name that was picked by
the program. Thus, the 'res == city' statement evaluated to true, and I got
the flag.
