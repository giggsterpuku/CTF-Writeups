Challenge: Compress and Attack
Category: Cryptography
Description: Your goal is to find the flag. compress_and_attack.py nc mercury.picoctf.net 50899 
Hints:
	-1: The flag only contains uppercase and lowercase letters, underscores, and braces (curly brackets)

The idea of the exploit for the chall lies within the way the plaintext is compressed during the encryption process. The Python script shows that
the plaintext is compressed using zlib, which after research I found uses the DEFLATE method of compression. The crux of the exploit lies within
said lossless compression method, which does two things: duplicate string elimination and bit reduction. The process of the method is that it finds
duplicate strings of data found in the overall data to be compressed, and in the shortened/compressed version of the data, it replaces the duplicate
strings with shorthanded back references that point back to their first instances in the data. So, the exploit is to look at the length of the
compressed encryption, which is given to us, and to bruteforce the flag knowing that the flag is appended onto the plaintext we give it. If the
resulting string is shorter than all the others of payloads of the same length, then that is the next subsequent letter in the flag. Initially I
thought that the exploit came from the stream cipher used to encrypt the plaintext and flag, Salsa20, but that as of now has yet to be cracked.
