Challenge: Some Assembly Required 3
Category: Web Exploitation
Description: 
Hints: (None)

Going through the Java source deobfuscating and decompiling the WebAssembly text like the previous two Some Assembly Required challs, and similar to
the second one, getting th flag has to do with looking at the copy() function. Looking at it, it seems like a character passed into it and its
corresponding index from your input is obfuscated in a cryptographic way using the 5-byte piece of data at offset 1067 as a key and XORing a byte
from it to your input. Basically, I just set up a decryption script to undo the XOR, and that got me the flag.
