Challenge: Some Assembly Required 1

Looking at the site, it seems that it checks whether or not you know the flag or not based on the flag that you input as the answer. Going into the .js file, I found it hard to understand, so I ran it through a deobfuscator. Furthermore, there were unknown arguements in the code that were still hard to read, but I learned that you can find their values using the console in the developer tools window in your browser. Once I got those values and plugged them into the code, it was more readable. The main function of attention in the file was the onButtonPress() function, which seems to use a WebAssembly file to check your input to the flag to see if your input is the flag. The location of the wasm file on the website can be found in the .js file, and grabbing it from the website and running strings, the flag is there.
