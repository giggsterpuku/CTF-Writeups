Challenge: Scaenger Hunt
Category: Web Exploitation
Description: There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/. Can you find it?
Hints:
	- 1: You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

There were five parts to the flag that you had to serach for in files. Parts 1 to 3 I found in the HTML, CSS, and robots.txt files, respectively. The other two I eventually found with hints from the preceding parts. For part 4, part 3 suggested that the web server hosting the sebsite is using the Apache application, and the hint word was Access. The fourth part ended up being a .htaccess file, which is a config file used per directory in the web root, and I accessed the file via typing the file name along with the URL in the browser. The hint from the 4th part leading to the 5th was that the website maker used a Mac that let him Store info. The hint alluded to the .DS_Store file, which is used on Apple devices by the Finder application to gather metadata for files/folders. Nothing too difficult, but I learned about the .htaccess and .DS_Store files and that was kewl.

*Sidenote: I did find in the website's .js file a comment asking how to prevent Google from indexing the website, and I learned that there is a noindex parameter that does it. You can include it in a meta tag in the HTML file or the X-Robots-Tag in an HTTP header.
