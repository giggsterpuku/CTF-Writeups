Challenge: Some Assembly Required 2

Hints: (None)

Like Some Assembly Required 1, the chall is abt WebAssembly. We grab it as usual, but the data segment where the flag was easily found last chall has a wierd lookin string. Using the WABT toolkit and using the wasm2wat and wasm-decompile, I looked through the decompiled and more readable code, and comparing it to the 1st chall's wasm decompiled junk, I found that the copy_char() function is different. It was modified so that each char of the imput is xor'ed with 8, meaning that your input xor'ed with 8 is compared to the data string that looks like mush. So, to get the flag, I xor'ed that messed up string by 8.
