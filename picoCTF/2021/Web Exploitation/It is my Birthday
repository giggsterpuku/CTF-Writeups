Challenge: It is my Birthday
Category: Web Exploitation
Description: I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar, and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision. Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my website. http://mercury.picoctf.net:50970/
Hints:
	-1: Look at the category of this problem.
	-2: How may a PHP site check the rules in the description?

The chall is centered around the idea of "magic hashes", which is described in this resource: https://github.com/spaze/hashes. Essentially, the idea is that there is a PHP-specific vulnerability where there is a comparison between two hashes using '==,' and by using it any two hashes starting with "0e" are evaluated to being the same. PHP interprets such hashes as 0 in scientific notation. The chall description says there needs to be an MD5 collision for the PDFs to work, but with this vuln, it will not be the case. I found two strings that evaluate to MD5 hashes starting with "0e" with this site: https://gist.github.com/atoponce/bb672d93233121560d2841f67e41698b. Then, I put them in two files w/ the extension ".pdf" using the cmd "echo -n <string>," which allows me to put the strings in the files w/o the newline character, preserving their magic hashes. Uploading them to the site, the index.php is shown with the flag. Looking at the file, it confirms the '==' evaulation.

<?php

if (isset($_POST["submit"])) {
    $type1 = $_FILES["file1"]["type"];
    $type2 = $_FILES["file2"]["type"];
    $size1 = $_FILES["file1"]["size"];
    $size2 = $_FILES["file2"]["size"];
    $SIZE_LIMIT = 18 * 1024;

    if (($size1 < $SIZE_LIMIT) && ($size2 < $SIZE_LIMIT)) {
        if (($type1 == "application/pdf") && ($type2 == "application/pdf")) {
            $contents1 = file_get_contents($_FILES["file1"]["tmp_name"]);
            $contents2 = file_get_contents($_FILES["file2"]["tmp_name"]);

            if ($contents1 != $contents2) {
                if (md5_file($_FILES["file1"]["tmp_name"]) == md5_file($_FILES["file2"]["tmp_name"])) { <- THIS IS THE BIG CHEESE
                    highlight_file("index.php");
                    die();
                } else {
                    echo "MD5 hashes do not match!";
                    die();
                }
            } else {
                echo "Files are not different!";
                die();
            }
        } else {
            echo "Not a PDF!";
            die();
        }
    } else {
        echo "File too large!";
        die();
    }
}
