Description: There is something on my shop network running at nc mercury.picoctf.net 59953, but I can't tell what it is. Can you?
Hints:
	- 1 : What language does a CNC machine use?

Nothing too hard, but it was fun to know that my engineering knowledge in my
ENGR7A course came in handy. From the hint, I remembered that CNC machines were
used in manufacturing mechanincal parts and 3D printing, and that is done
using a language that the machines can intetpret: GCode. From the stream that
I got from the remote connection, I plugged those commands into an online
GCode interpreter and CNC viewer (https://ncviewer.com/), "printing out" my flag.
