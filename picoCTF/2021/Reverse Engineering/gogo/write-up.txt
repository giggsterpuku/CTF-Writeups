Description: Hmmm this is a weird file... enter_password. There is a instance of the service running at mercury.picoctf.net:48728.
Hints:
	- 1: use go tool objdump or ghidra

Opening the file in Ghidra, it seems to be a binary written in the Go language.
The main functions can be found in the "ma" function folder, which contains the
"main.<fxn>" functions, which I presume are the main functions coded into the
program (excluding library functions). The primary fxn to check was
main.checkPassword(), which seemed to XOR your input with another hex string.
Then it compares the XOR'ed stuff to a value. To see what values are being
XOR'ed I looked into it via GDB. I made a breakpoint somewhere after the
values being XOR'ed and compared to the XOR'ed input so to see what they are.
There is a hash-looking number and a hex string that can be found by looking at
data in the stack at offsets $sp+4 and $sp+24. XORing them together, I find the
password to pass is "reverseengineericanbarelyforward." When I put that input
into the prgram, it them asks for the unhashed value stored somewhere idk. The
hash that you needed to crack was the hash-lookin string from earlier, and
if you ran it through an MD5 decrypter, the corresponding value would be
"goldfish." Once sending that it, the flag was recovered.
