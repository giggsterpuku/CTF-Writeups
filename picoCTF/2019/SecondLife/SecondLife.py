# Category: Binary Exploitation
# Points: 400 (solved after comp)
# Description: Just pwn this program using a double free and get a flag. Itâ€™s also found in /problems/secondlife_2_ecf87473c7934afc6ea15edd2ee954ca on the shell server.
#
# The way we exploit this chall is the same as the one for AfterLife, except that the vuln
# is caused by a double free, which is free()ing an already freed chunk. Because of the
# vuln, the fd and bk pointers of the "first" points to itself, and when the program
# malloc()s the "sixth" chunk, when gets(sixth) is run, you are writing into the "first"
# chunk. The double free also allows a second instance of the "first" chunk to be in
# the fastbin list, thus allowing for GOT overwrite via unlink attack.
#
# Flag: picoCTF{HeapHeapFlag_d11a9aaf}
# Solved by: Ryan Nguyen
