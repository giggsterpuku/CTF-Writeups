Challenge: wine
Category: Binary Exploitation
Description: Challenge best paired with wine. I love windows. Checkout my exe running on a linux box. You can view source here. And connect with it using nc saturn.picoctf.net 53434
Hints:
	-1: Gets is dangerous. Even on windows.

Basically I learned that Windows executables din't escape b0fs, they are
done the same way as with a Linux ELF binaries. Basic b0f ret2win, and the
flag popped out.
