Challenge: Sum-O-Primes
Category: Cryptography
Description: We have so much faith in RSA we give you not just the product of the primes, but their sum as well! gen.py output.txt
Hints:
	-1: I love squares :)

I really like how you can use algebra to solve an RSA chall! Really OG
Algebra 1 tactics too. So the nubmers given are the sum of the primes, n,
and the ciphertext c. To find p and q, I set up a quadratic equation.
Basically, p and q are the roots of the equation, and the way to find them
is to realize that they create a difference of squares, which come in this
form: (x - p)(x - q) = x^2 - (p + q)x + pq. We are give pq (n) and p + q
(the sum of the primes), so I made a script to find the roots and p and q
were found. The rest is just RSA calculations. Nice!
