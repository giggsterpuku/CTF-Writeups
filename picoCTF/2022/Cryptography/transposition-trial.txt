# Challenge: transposition-trial
# Category: Cryptography
# Description: Our data got corrupted on the way here. Luckily, nothing got replaced, but every block of 3 got scrambled around! The first word seems to be three letters long, maybe you can use that to recover the rest of the message. Download the corrupted message here.
# Hints:
#	-1: Split the message up into blocks of 3 and see how the first block is scrambled
#
# Ez chall, but I justed wanted to take notes on it. Transposition ciphers
# are basically crypto algorithms used to rearrange characters in plaintext
# messages so that they look completely unfamiliar. This one happens to be
# a columnar tranposition, in which you can arrange every certain number
# of chars (in this case 3) into rows that go down by column, and then you
# can shift the order of the columns and take the results and put them
# together to get a ciphertext. The shift here is that the first letter
# in the 3-letter row is moved from the first (leftmost) column to the
# last (rightmost) column. Undoing that gets you the flag. I made this
# script to automate that process for me.
