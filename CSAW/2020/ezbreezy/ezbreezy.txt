Prompt: This binary has nothing to hide!

This challenge seem like some really wack way to show you how you can
somehow find hidden info through disassembly. In the "app" binary, the
only function that stuck out to me that I noticed was one that
opened a file called "not_even_real.txt," and for some dumb reason I 
thought that would show how to find the flag, but I saw nothing that checks
any of the text in the file. Yet, being the dumb boy i am, I still try to
bruteforce the flag through that. After looking at a couple of writeups, 
I found that there was a section names a wierd name (.aj1ishudgqis),
and I found that there was some disassembly under it. Apparently, the flag
could be found by taking all the byte values (not DWORD values) passed into
the stack and subtracting some offset (40) from them to decipher the flag. 
Like I said, really wack. Seems more like to forensics-type problem than a
rev one but ok. Also, the flag that I found had one char wrong, so I 
guessed it.
* Sidenote: dns and green beans also think the chall was gay *

Flag: flag{u_h4v3_r3c0v3r3d_m3}
