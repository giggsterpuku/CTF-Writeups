Challenge: prime

Description: is it prime? (Remote server: nc challs.wreckctf.com 3127)

Nothing really special about the chall, kind of more like a rev chall but thinking with prime numbers. Looking at the
script, it seems it has to take 71 inputted numbers in order to get the flag. The first number has two constraints:
it has to be between 1020 and 1028 bits, and it must be prime. The rest of the 70 numbers are basically compared to each
other to see if they are coprime (GCD of the two numbers is 1) and that they divide the first number. So, I used a
script to generate a prime number for the first input and for the other 70 numbers I figured that that prime number
can only be divisible by 1, so all 70 numbers must be 1. Plus they are technically coprime with each other in the sense
that their GCDs with each other is 1. Running th script, you get the flag. EZPZ.
