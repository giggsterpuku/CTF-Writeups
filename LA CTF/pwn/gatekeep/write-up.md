# Challenge: gatekeep

**Category:** pwn

**Description:** If I gaslight you enough, you won't be able to get my flag! :)

## Breaking down the source code



## What seems to be the intended play

## What I think is the :cheese:

The way that I actually solved the chall came from a chall that I remembered doing in the 2021 AngestromCTF competition to perform the exploit that I used for the Secure Login chall. My write-up in a text file can be found [here](https://github.com/giggsterpuku/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/angstromCTF/2021/Secure_Login/Secure_Login.txt). You can also find the files associated with the chall in the same directory. Essentially, the ðŸ§€ exploit comes from the generation of the password, which is made with the randomly generated bytes of /dev/urandom, along with strcmp() being used to compare the input and the password. strcmp() uses compares the two arguments until either argument terminates with a null byte. Since there is a chance that the first character taken from /dev/urandom starts with a null byte, I just have to keep sending a null byte to the remote service until the strcmp() check is passed.

**Note:** The ðŸ§€ exploit may take a while to get the flag.
