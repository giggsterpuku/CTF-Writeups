Looking at the PNG file and running pngcheck on it, it seemed like the problem
stems from something called CRC (also hinted by the capital letters in the
description). I looked up what CRC meant, and it stands for Cyclic Redundancy
Check, which is a checksum created to verify the validity of the file and
ensure it wasn't tampered. However, with the CRC error made my the image, a
piece of data is indicated to have changed. The other description that I got
when I check w/ pngcheck (run -v -f for more description and look for all
errors) was that there were invalid dimensions (0 by 0 hmmmm). I further
looked up the PNG file format and found that data is split up into multiple
chunks, and the chunk that holds the dimensions was the IHDR chunk. The CRC
checksum for that chunk was created based off the dimensions. Thus, my
solution was to find the dimensions that created the checksum, so I was able
to find it with my bruteforce script. The dimensions ended up being 688 by
688, and so I edited the first 8 bytes in the IHDR chunk after the "IHDR"
bytes via hexedit. First 4 bytes were for width, next 4 for height. When I
saved the edited image data and opened it in a photo viewer, I got the image
and the flag.
