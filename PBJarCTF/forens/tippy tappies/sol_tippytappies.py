# Description: how'd you get this in the first place :eyes: dids you has logger on me?
# Author: ZeroDayTea
#
# I saw the packets on Wireshark and saw that the packets are using a USB
# protocol, but I was not sure what to do with it. Funny enough, my YouTube recs
# gave this blessed video of Lord John Hammond doing a similar chall in picoCTF
# 2017: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HXL4RGmExo&ab_channel=JohnHammond. The
# key here is that there is "leftover data" in packets starting from packet 65,
# and a byte inside the data corresponds to the to a USB HID table, which has
# values that correspond to keys on a keyboard/any other Human Input Device
# (hence HID). So, I grabbed a table from online and used it in this script in
# a dictionary. From there, I learned to use the python module scapy from the
# video and translate the keyboard codes into readable text. From there, I was
# able to obtain and figure out the flag.
