# The title name reminded me of the m00nwalk chall in picoCTF 2019, where an
# image is embedded into ham radio signals, so it gave me the idea to decode
# the audio file using slow-scan TV (SSTV). Opening the file, the audio just
# sounds like wierd alien sounds, and looking at the spectometry graphs in
# Audacity, there was no noticeable patterns. So, I looked into a m00nwalk
# write-up and learned how to use a software decoder (QSSTV) to decode the
# audio into an image. The image ended up being the picture of the Apollo 11
# moon landing, and its location on the Moon was the flag. You can follow the
# tutorial here to decode the audio file:
