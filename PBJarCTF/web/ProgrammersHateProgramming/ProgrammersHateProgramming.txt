In this chall I properly learned how to perform cross site scripting (aka XSS).
Looking at the website, it seems like a normal site to make notes on, but when
I looked into the source code, it seems that the notes you make on the website
are actually .php files, so their contents could be interpreted as code. If you
clicked on those notes, the code would then be executed and you would see the
results of the code. Then, using OSINT, I learned how to make code to open
a flag.txt file, but when I put it into the site and clicked the note it was in,
the code was missing some parts, like the "flag" in "flag.txt". Looking back at
the PHP source code, I realized they made a blacklist with str_replace_first(),
clearing wherever flag, <?php, etc. were at. Then, I realized that the blacklist
function only clears the first instance of those keywords it targets, so I just
added those keywords before my code to negate it. I tried clicking my note, and
this time it worked, but there was not flag.txt. So, I used the PHP system()
function to locate a flag file (system("find / flag")), and there was a
/flag.php file. From there, I tailored my payload to read its contents.
Here are two payloads that work:
<?phpflag?> <?php $myfile = fopen("/flag.php", "r") or die("Unable to open file!"); echo fread($myfile,filesize("/flag.php")); fclose($myfile); ?>
<?phpflag?> <?php system("cat /flag.php") ?>
