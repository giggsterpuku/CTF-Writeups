Prompt: Mommy! what is a file descriptor in Linux?
ssh fd@pwnable.kr -p2222 (pw:guest)

I looked to see what were the contents of user fd's home directory, and 
there were 3 files that stood out: fd, fd.c, and flag. The flag file
is what we are trying to open to get the flag for the challenge, however
its contents cannot be shown due to file perms. So, I looked into fd.c 
since I could read it and found what I needed to do with its corresponding
executeable. The input (a number) is first taken in, converted into an 
integer form, and subtracted by 0x1234. Then the system reads the
resulting number as a file descriptor, which is the indicator used to
determine the input/output of a program (0 for input, 1 for standard
output, and 2 for standard error). Lastly, there is some more input 
taken in, it is compared to the string "LETMEWIN." If both the input and
string are the same, the flag is outputted. Inferring about the information
of the fildes, I figured that I needed  the resultant number from the 
first input to be equal to 0 so that I can add more input to compare to 
"LETMEWIN." Thus, to get the 0, I inputted the decimal number 4660 to be 
subracted from 0x1234, its equal in hex form. The program then stalls, 
signifying that I am prompted for input. I typed in "LETMEWIN," and the 
program outputted the flag.

Flag: mommy! I think I know what a file descriptor is!!
