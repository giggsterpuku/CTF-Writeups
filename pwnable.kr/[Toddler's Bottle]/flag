I was disappointed how easy this task was, but then again this is supposed to 
be one of the easiest challenges. I first tried running it, and all the 
program said was "I will malloc() and strcpy the flag there. take it." No flag
came. ;( So, I tried looking into the assembly code using gdb, but it did not
find any functions. I later found that it was compressed by a file compression
software named UPX, so I downloaded it and decompressed the binary (package is
upx on apt, command to decompress is upx -d flag). I was then able to look into
the assembly, and in the main function it seemed that only the malloc() function
was called, not the strcmp() function. Almost as if it was too obvious I
realized I had not checked the human-readable strings in the binary, so I ran
strings on it. Thus, the lame flag was found.

Flag: UPX...? sounds like a delivery service :)
