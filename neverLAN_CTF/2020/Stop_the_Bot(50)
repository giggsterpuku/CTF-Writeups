Ok so the names says bots in it
This must mean it is referring to security technique with robots.txt
This file on the website determines what engine crawlers or web robots can
request for certain pages or files on the site
These crawler or bots are used to collect intel on websites so ppl can exploit
then
Add /robots.txt to the end of the link and refresh
You should now see three fields (User: *, Disallow: /, and Disallow: flag.txt)
Well, since there is a * in the User field, anyone can go view those
directories and files on the system that are prohibited (no very secure, is it?)
Just go to the original link and add /flag.txt to the end to get the flag
Flag: flag{n0_b0ts_all0w3d}
