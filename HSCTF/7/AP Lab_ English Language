Prompt: The AP English Language activity will ask you to reverse a program about manipulating strings 
and arrays. Again, an output will be given where you have to reconstruct an input.

Just like the AP CompSci rev chall, I made the functions do the opposite to get the flag. This time,
the input is put into a transpose function that moves the letters of the flag around in a certain order
specified by an array and then xor'ed into an xor function. This happens in a loop three times. So, to 
undo the string in the program, I made the loop xor the input and then transpose it. I did not need to 
change the xor function since xor'ing a string twice makes it the original string. For the transpose 
function, I noted the positions of the original string's characters in the new string and made an array 
of the indexes of those original characters in the new string to run the function through. The flag came
out wrong, but I just neede to change a few charcters to make it right.

Flag: flag{n0t_t00_b4d_r1ght}
