Prompt: This activity will ask you to reverse a basic program and solve an 
introductory reversing challenge. You will be given an output that is to be 
used in order to reconstruct the input, which is the flag.
[Note: The "Student Guide" isn't needed to solve the challenges in this series.]

I first started off trying to determine what the program did, so I looked into 
the code. The program first prompts for and input, and then it processes it into
the shift() function, which shifts each character in the input one ASCII 
character lower than the previous character. Next, the input is processed into
shift2(), which shifts the characters in the string up 2 places. The program
compares the final string with the value "inagzgkpm)Wl&Tg&io" to see if it is 
equal and then tells in the output whether your input is the flag or not. Once 
I determined what it did, I edited the program to make it do the opposite of 
what it did, changing the shifting functions and having the program run shift() 
on the input before shift2(). I used the value compared in the program as the 
input, and I got the flag by running the program.
