Ok I am basically making a writup of what Rahil did. I guessed only some of the stuff in it. So when you run the file,
it says this: "So you figured out how to provide input and command line arguments. But can you figure out what input to
 provide?" Without any arguments, it said: "Make sure you have the correct amount of command line arguments!" So, I first
tested how many arguments to put until it put out a different output. Once I got four arguments, it said: "Don't try to 
guess the arguments, it won't work." Now I know the number of arguments to use is 4. Next (here comes Poggers) I pulled
up a decompiler (IDA in this case) and saw what the code was if it was in C. I only focused on the if statements, since it 
would show what arguments to use. The first three arguments were first checked to see if they were numbers between 0 and 9.
Then, if they were, the if statement was something like this: <arg1>*10 + <arg2>*100 + <arg3> == 932. The three arguments 
must be 3, 9, and 2 in order. If that goes through, fourth argument was compared to the string "chicken." That means the 
fourth parameter must be "chicken." Once you put those arguments in, the program then asks for your password. The password
was XORed with 0x2a or something like that to match it up with a variable called "desired." What I then did is XOR each 
byte in "desired" with 0x2a to get the password. Since the program reads it like a letter sting, I converted what I got
into ASCII, which then was "please give flag." I entered that and gave me the flag.

FYI: This was after the competition ended. This was the only challenge I worked on the rest of the CTF after the second day.
:)
