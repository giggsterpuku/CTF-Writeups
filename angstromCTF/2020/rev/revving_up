Prompt: Clam wrote a program for his school's cybersecurity club's first rev
 lecture! Can you get it to give you the flag? You can find it at 
/problems/2020/revving_up on the shell server, which you can access via the 
"shell" link at the top of the site.

The challenge here is trying to let you understand how inputs and arguments
work. First I ran the revving_up executable and it prompted me to type "give
flag," and what you do is type it out. That is the input going into the 
program. Then the program asks you to run it again but this time with a command
 line argument of "banana." What you do is run it this way: 
./reving_up banana. After that, it asks you to input "give flag" and the flag
is yours. The takeaway from the challenge is this: input is given when the
program is run; arguments are taken when the program is prompted to execute.
