Prompt: Find my password from this recording (:
* File attached was recording.pcapng *

From the file extension name I figure it is a packet capture, so Wireshark
would required to solve this challenge. I honestly don't know how to use it,
so ran strings on it to get its human-readable text and searched for the flag,
and luckily I got it. FYI: The command I used is strings recording.pcapng | 
grep actf.

*Someone w/ Wireshark skills please make a better write-up.*
Flag: actf{wireshark_isn't_so_bad_huh-a9d8g99ikdf}
