Prompt: Hey! My friend sent me a message... He said encrypted it with the key 
ANGSTROMCTF. He mumbled what cipher he used, but I think I have a clue.
Gotta go though, I have history homework!!

Looking at the challenge name, it is easy to see that the cipher is a keyed 
ceasar. Essentially, the alphabet, used in the cipher to map shifts, is changed
by a phrase (in this case ANGSTROMCTF). The phrase is put at the begining of 
the alphabet, and the duplicate letters in the alphabet are omitted. A shift 
further encrypts the plaintext. This challege did not require a shift, only
the key.
