Challenge: Confetti
Category: Misc
Description: "From the sky, drop like confetti All eyes on me, so V.I.P All of my dreams, from the sky, drop like confetti" - Little Mix confetti.png

I ran the file through exiftool, and I found in a section laebeled [minor] that
there is written data after the IEND chunk, which ususally ends the PNG file.
Looking up what could be the forensics clue, I found a solution to the problem,
which suggested that there were additional PNG files concatenated to the file
we were given. First, I used xxd to give a hexdump of the files and grep'd the
output for the term "PNG," which shows where the magic bytes are in the single
file. Four lines popped up, indicating that there are 4 PNG files in the file.
The memory addressed where one file ends and another starts are also in the
grep output, so I used them to carve out the images using dd. As a summary,
I ran this command and its options: dd if=confetti.png of=<file#>.png skip=
<where PNG file starts> count=<byte size of file, calculated using offsets> bs=1
Looking at the second image in the file after carving, it spewed the flag. Nice!
